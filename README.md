## About

I’m a software engineer with 6+ years of experience across backend development, infrastructure, and reliability engineering.  
I enjoy working on systems that are **predictable in production**, **clean in design**, and **useful long after they’re built**.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- frontend & backend engineering
- infrastructure & reliability
- applied security
- developer experience

I value clarity over cleverness and long-term maintainability over short-term wins.

## Notes

I tend to prefer:
- simple systems over complex ones  
- automation over repetition  
- boring production over exciting outages  
- documentation that explains *why*, not just *what*  

If you’re interested in backend systems, infra, security, or thoughtful engineering, you’ll likely find something here that resonates.
